# CiviCRM Fields

This is module is in early development. It allows a user to create a field that
will allow selection of a CiviCRM Contribution or Event Registration page, 
which can then be inserted onto the page when the field is displayed.

## Installation

- Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

## Configuration and Usage

- Make sure CiviCRM is installed and you have one or more active Contribution Pages
set up and/or an active CiviEvent.
- Install this module as usual
- Add a field of the "CiviCRM Page" type to an entity (e.g. a content type or
   taxonomy term)
- Create content of that type and you should be able to select a page to insert
